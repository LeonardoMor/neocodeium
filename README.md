<summary>Motivation and differences with <a href="https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim">codeium.vim</a></summary>

**Motivation**

The primary reason for creating NeoCodeium was to address the
issue of flickering suggestions in the official plugin. This flickering was
particularly annoying when dealing with multiline virtual text. Additionally,
I desired a feature that would allow accepted Codeium suggestions to be
repeatable using the `.`, because I use it as my main completion plugin and
only manually invoke nvim-cmp.

**Differences**

- Supports only neovim (written in lua).
- Flickering has been removed in most scenarios, resulting in a snappier experience.
- Completions on the current line can now be repeated using the `.` key.
- Performance improvements have been achieved through cache techniques.
- The suggestion count label is displayed in the number column, making it closer to the context.
- Default keybindings have been removed.
- Possibility to complete only word/line of the suggestion.
- By default, there is no debounce, allowing suggestions to appear while
  typing. If you don't like this behavior, set `debounce = true` in the setup.

</details>

> [!Warning]
> Currently, it only works on neovim's nightly build.

> [!Note]
> The plugin is beta quality. Has not been tested on Windows at all (the code for its support was adopted from [codeium.vim]).
>
> Please report any issues on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/monkoose/neocodeium/issues).

### üì¶ Installation

Here‚Äôs an example for üí§[lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager. If you're using
a different plugin manager, please refer to its documentation for installation instructions.

```lua
-- add this to the file where you setup your other plugins:
{
  "monkoose/neocodeium",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  config = function()
    local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")
    neocodeium.setup()
    vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-f>", neocodeium.accept)
  end,
}

```

Now you can use `Alt-f` in insert mode to accept codeium suggestions.

**Note:** To obtain an API token, you‚Äôll need to run `:NeoCodeium auth`.

### üöÄ Usage

#### üìí API
In addition to the already mentioned `accept()` function, the plugin also provides a few other:

```lua
local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")

-- Accepts the suggestion
neocodeium.accept()

-- Accepts only part of the suggestion if the full suggestion doesn't make sense
neocodeium.accept_word()
neocodeium.accept_line()

-- Clears the current suggestion
neocodeium.clear()

-- Cycles through suggestions by `n` (1 by default) items. Use a negative value to cycle in reverse order
neocodeium.cycle(n)

-- Same as `cycle()`, but also tries to show suggestions if none is visible.
-- Mostly useful with the enabled `manual` option
neocodeium.cycle_or_complete(n)
```

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Keybindings

NeoCodeium doesn‚Äôt enforce any keybindings, so you‚Äôll need to add them
yourself. While [codeium.vim] and
[copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) set the `<Tab>` keybinding
as the default for completion, but there are some downsides to consider (but nothing stops you from using it):
- **Risk of Interference:** There‚Äôs a high chance of it conflicting with other plugins (such as snippets, nvim-cmp, etc.).
- **Not Consistent:** It doesn‚Äôt work in the `:h command-line-window`.
- **Indentation Challenges:** It can make it harder to indent with the tab at the start of a line.

Suggested keybindings:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-f>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-w>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept_word()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-a>", function()
    require("neocodeium").accept_line()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-e>", function()
    require("neocodeium").cycle_or_complete()
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-r>", function()
    require("neocodeium").cycle_or_complete(-1)
end)
vim.keymap.set("i", "<A-c>", function()
    require("neocodeium").clear()
end)
```

#### üî§ Commands

NeoCodeium provides `:NeoCodeium` user command, which has some useful actions:
- `:NeoCodeium auth` - authenticates the user and saves the API token.
- `:NeoCodeium disable` - disables NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium enable` - enables NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium toggle` - toggles NeoCodeium completion.
- `:NeoCodeium disable_buffer` - disables NeoCodeium completion in the current buffer.
- `:NeoCodeium enable_buffer` - enables NeoCodeium completion in the current buffer.

#### üé® Color groups

NeoCodeium offers a couple of color groups that you can customize to match your colorscheme:
- `NeoCodeiumSuggestion` - corresponds to the virtual text color (default: darkgray)
- `NeoCodeiumLabel` - represents the label indicating the number of suggestions (default: inverted DiagnosticInfo)

Feel free to adjust these colors to your preference and enhance your NeoCodeium experience!

#### nvim-cmp integration

If you want to disable NeoCodeium suggestions when nvim-cmp menu is visible,
you can use this code snippet in your config to achieve this:

```lua
local cmp = require("cmp")
local neocodeium = require("neocodeium")

-- Make codeium suggestions appear only when `nvim-cmp` menu is closed
cmp.event:on("menu_opened", function()
  vim.cmd("NeoCodeium disable")
  neocodeium.clear()
end)
cmp.event:on("menu_closed", function()
  vim.cmd("NeoCodeium enable")
end)
```

### ‚öíÔ∏è Setup

NeoCodeium comes with the following default options:

```lua
-- NeoCodeium Configuration
require("neocodeium").setup({
  -- Enable NeoCodeium at startup
  enabled = true,
  -- Path to a custom Codeium server binary (you can download one from: https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium/releases)
  bin = nil,
  -- When set to `true`, autosuggestions are disabled. Use `require'neodecodeium'.cycle_or_complete()` to show suggestions manually
  manual = false,
  -- Information about the API server to use
  server = {
    -- The API URL to use (for Enterprise mode)
    api_url = nil,
    -- The portal URL to use (for registering a user and downloading the binary)
    portal_url = nil,
  },
  -- Set to `false` to disable showing the number of suggestions label at the line column
  show_label = true,
  -- Set to `true` to enable suggestions debounce
  debounce = false,
  -- Maximum number of lines parsed from non-current loaded buffers
  -- Set to `0` to disable parsing non-current buffers (may lower suggestion quality)
  -- Set it to `-1` to parse all lines
  max_lines = 10000,
  -- Path to a custom log file
  log_file = nil,
  -- Set to `false` to disable suggestions in buffers with specific filetypes
  filetypes = {
    help = false,
    gitcommit = false,
    gitrebase = false,
    ["."] = false,
  },
})
```

### üöó Roadmap

- [ ] Add vimdoc help
- [ ] Add command to open buffer with the log output
- [ ] Add :checkhealth
- [ ] Add support for Codeium Chat
- [ ] Add new renderer with floating windows instead of virtual text
